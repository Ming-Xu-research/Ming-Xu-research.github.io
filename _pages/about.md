Welcom to my homepage! Lorem ipsum.

### Bio
My name is Ming Xu （徐铭). I am a research fellow in National University of Singapore. I received my Ph.D degree from School of Computer Science, Fudan University, China in June, 2023. I am very fortunate to closely work with Prof. Weili Han (my supervisor) and Dr. Xinyi Zhang at Fudan University. 

I am interested in pursuing the beautiful convergence of chaotic data into informed insights in the usable security and privacy aspects. For example, the chaotic data consists of textual passwords and security event logs:

  - **Patterns**: Textual passwords have their specifically-used patterns like ``p@ssw0rd4ever'' [CCS'21, TIFS'20](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460120.3484743).
  - **Understandings**: Patterns are useful in improving real-world guessing [USENIX SEC'23](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/xu-ming).  
  - **Applications**: Patterns and understandings can help a more reliable password strength meter. Security event logs can help monitor the anomalities in real time [ASE'24]. 



**Recently, I have several opportunities for visiting/master/PhD in NCS-NUS lab especially for LLMs. If you are interested in joining or remotely working with us, feel free to drop an email to me: mingxu@nus.edu.sg**
