Welcom to the Ming Xu's Homepage! Lorem ipsum.

### Bio
My name is Ming Xu （徐铭). I received my Ph.D degree from School of Computer Science, Fudan University, China in June, 2023. I am very fortunate to closely work with Prof. Weili Han (my supervisor) and Dr. Xinyi Zhang in the past five years at Fudan University. 

I have a broad interest in security and privacy, with a particular focus on usable security and privacy. My approach involves leveraging modern data-driven models to empower users in making informed decisions. Over the past five years (2018-), I have actively contributed to this field by publishing in top-tier conferences and journals such as USENIX Security, CCS, ACSAC, TIFS, among others.

### Research Interests
Usable security and security  
Textual password security    
LLM's secuirty and privacy

I am willing to work together on interesting projects with external collaborators. Do not hesitate to drop me an email if you are interested!
