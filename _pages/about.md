Welcom to the Ming Xu's Homepage! Lorem ipsum.

My name is Ming Xu （徐铭). I am graduating from School of Computer Science, Fudan University in data security and analyse lab superized by Prof Weili Han. Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree from Yunnan University.

I specialize in the field of password security research, focusing on various aspects of the textual password ecosystem. My particular interests lie in exploring the internal paradigms of passwords, using modern data-driven models to support decision-makings. Over the past five years (2018-), I have actively contributed to this field by publishing more than 5 papers as the primary authors in top-tier conferences and journals such as USENIX Security, CCS, TIFS, among others.
