Welcom to the Ming Xu's Homepage! Lorem ipsum.

My name is Ming Xu （徐铭). I received my Ph.D degree from School of Computer Science, Fudan University, China, advised by Prof Weili Han in June, 2023. Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in computer science from Yunnan University. 

I specialize in the field of usable security and privacy, focusing on using modern data-driven models to support users' decision-makings. My particular interests lie in applying the natural-language-processing techniques (e.g, pre-trained model) to password security and analysis. Over the past five years (2018-), I have actively contributed to this field by publishing more than 5+ papers as the primary authors in top-tier conferences and journals such as USENIX Security, CCS, TIFS, among others.
