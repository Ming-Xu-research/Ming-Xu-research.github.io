Welcom to my homepage! Lorem ipsum.

### Bio
My name is Ming Xu （徐铭). I am a research fellow in National University of Singapore. I received my Ph.D degree from School of Computer Science, Fudan University, China in June, 2023. I am very fortunate to closely work with Prof. Weili Han (my supervisor) and Dr. Xinyi Zhang at Fudan University. 

I am interested in pursuing the beautiful convergence of chaotic data into informed insights in the usable security and privacy aspects. Over the past years, I have actively contributed to this field by publishing in top-tier conferences and journals such as USENIX Security, CCS, ACSAC, TIFS, among others. **Recently, I have several opportunities for visiting/master/PhD in NCS-NUS lab especially for LLMs. If you are interested in joining or remotely working with us, feel free to drop an email to me: mingxu@nus.edu.sg**
