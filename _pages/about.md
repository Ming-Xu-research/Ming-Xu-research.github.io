Welcom to the Ming Xu's Homepage! Lorem ipsum.

My name is Ming Xu （徐铭). I received my Ph.D degree from School of Computer Science, Fudan University, China. I am very fortunate to closely work with Prof. Weili Han (my supervisor) and Dr. Xinyi Zhang in the past five years at Fudan University. 

I am broadly interested in security and privacy topics. I specialize in the field of usable security and privacy, utilizing contemporary data-driven models to empower users in making informed decisions. My specific interests lie in textual password security and analysis, with the ultimate goal of creating passwords that are both memorable and secure. Over the past five years (2018-), I have actively contributed to this field by publishing more than 5+ papers as the primary authors in top-tier conferences and journals such as USENIX Security, CCS, TIFS, among others.
