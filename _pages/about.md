Welcom to my homepage! Lorem ipsum.

### Bio
My name is Ming Xu （徐铭). I am a research fellow in National University of Singapore. I received my Ph.D degree from School of Computer Science, Fudan University, China in June, 2023. I am very fortunate to closely work with Prof. Weili Han (my supervisor) and Dr. Xinyi Zhang at Fudan University. 

My research interests focus on usable security and privacy. My approach involves leveraging modern data-driven models to empower users in making informed decisions regarding systems like security operation centers or textual password creations. Over the past years, I have actively contributed to this field by publishing in top-tier conferences and journals such as USENIX Security, CCS, ACSAC, TIFS, among others. **Recently, I have several opportunities for visiting/master/PhD in NCS-NUS lab especially for LLMs. If you are interested in joining or remotely working with us, feel free to drop an email to me: mingxu@nus.edu.sg**
