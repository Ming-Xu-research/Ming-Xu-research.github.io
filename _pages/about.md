Welcom to my homepage!

### Bio
My name is Ming Xu（徐铭). I am a research fellow in National University of Singapore. I received my Ph.D. Degree from Fudan University under the supervision of Prof. Weili Han. I am very fortunate to work closely with Dr. Xinyi Zhang during my PhD studies. 

I am working to protect the digital safety of everyone online in the usable security and privacy aspects. My interests span security, privacy, fraud, misinformation, and practical applications of artificial intelligence and LLMs. I typically discoving the underlying patterns, exploring novel threat models, and integrating them into practical applications.  

  - **Patterns**: Textual passwords have their specifically-used patterns like ``p@ssw0rd4ever'' [CCS'21, TIFS'20](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460120.3484743).
  - **Understandings**: Real-world guessing scenarios [USENIX SEC'23](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/xu-ming); Privacy risks within PSMs [AsiaCCS'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08292)  
  - **Applications**: LLM-based Web Anomaly Detectors [ASE'24](https://jasonbourne1998.github.io/data/ASE24.pdf). Real-world Password Guessers [TDSC'25](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=7zMod48AAAAJ&citation_for_view=7zMod48AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC)


**Recently, I have several opportunities for visiting/master/PhD in NCS-NUS lab especially for LLMs. If you are interested in joining or remotely working with us, feel free to drop an email to me: mingxu@nus.edu.sg**
