Welcom to my homepage! Lorem ipsum.

### Bio
My name is Ming Xu （徐铭). Currently, I am a research fellow in National University of Singapore. I received my Ph.D degree from School of Computer Science, Fudan University, China in June, 2023. I am very fortunate to closely work with Prof. Weili Han (my supervisor) and Dr. Xinyi Zhang in the past five years at Fudan University. 

My research interests focus on usable security and privacy. My approach involves leveraging modern data-driven models to empower users in making informed decisions. Over the past five years (2018-), I have actively contributed to this field by publishing in top-tier conferences and journals such as USENIX Security, CCS, ACSAC, TIFS, among others. **If you are interested in my topics, please do not hesitate to contact me.**
